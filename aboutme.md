We are the members of a young laboratory supervised by [Vincent Maire](https://sites.google.com/site/vincentmairefolio/), oriented toward functional plant and ecosystem ecology. This site is dedicated to our analysis or statistical explorations, oriented to codes and mathematical background.

For more about us and our publications, see [our researchgate page](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Laboratoire-decologie-fonctionnelle-vegetale-LEAF-Vincent-Maire)
