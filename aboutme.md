We are the members of a young laboratory supervised by [Vincent Maire](https://sites.google.com/site/vincentmairefolio/) and [Esther LÃ©vesque](http://www.cen.ulaval.ca/membre.php?id=1252510&cat=11&membre=), oriented toward functional plant and ecosystem ecology. This site is dedicated to our analysis or statistical explorations, oriented toward codes and mathematical background.
